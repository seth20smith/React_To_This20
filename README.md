# React_To_This20


Using React for the first time , I was able to convert a resume from plain HTML into React.
Created links to projects within the resume and used the APP.JS to create a function launching the JS function to display the website.
The websites has a header with NAV links to quickly get through the page, including contact information and links to other work on the footer of the Page.
